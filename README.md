# PD-Quant
PD Quant (Public Data) is an attempt to aggregate, clean, and visualize data from various public sources. The US Gov't publishes a plethora of free and open source financial and economic data. PD Quant attempts to pull all of that together in one place, so investors do not have to waste time and have everything they need in one place.
