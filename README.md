# PD-Quant
PD Quant (Public Data) is an attempt to aggregate, clean, and visualize data from various public sources. The US Gov't publishes a plethora of free and open source financial and economic data. PD Quant is designed to pull all of that together in one place, so investors do not have to waste time and have everything they need in one place. 
Currently only pulling from SEC.gov's public API. 
Short-Term Road Map: Add in FRED, Yahoo Finance, FEC, and Congress Lobbying Data. Add in derivative data for all these sources.
Long-Term Road Map: Eventually will pull from SAM.gov and FPDS.gov for federal contracting data- more derivative data for all sources.
